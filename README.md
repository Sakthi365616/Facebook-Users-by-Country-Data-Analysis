Facebook Users by Country Data Analysis to ensure which type of counties have more Facebook users and what factors playing major roles etc..
## Description:
+ Increase social media usage: To increase the number of Facebook users, efforts can be made to encourage people to use social media more frequently. This could include creating engaging content, launching marketing campaigns, and improving the user experience of the platform.

+ Target high-population countries: To increase the overall number of Facebook users, efforts can be focused on countries with high populations, such as India, China, and the United States. These countries have a large potential user base, and targeting them with advertising and marketing efforts could help to increase Facebook's overall user count.

+ Improve user retention: While the correlation between the number of users and population is positive, it is not very strong. This suggests that there are other factors that influence whether people use Facebook or not. Efforts can be made to improve user retention by offering new and innovative features, improving the platform's security and privacy measures, and addressing concerns related to misinformation and fake news. By doing so, Facebook can retain more of its current users and attract new ones, leading to a stronger positive correlation between user count and population.
